Sediq-Sky Multi Application Telemetry Module
============================================

The goal of this project is to build a telemetry module that captures GPS and various other sensor data and transmits that data back to a base station. This project aims to be useful in both the field of amature rocketry and high-altitude balloons.

**Note:** This project is a new project, and will soon include contributions from multiple individuals.
