Sediq-Sky Multi Application Telemetry Module
============================================

The goal of this project is to build a telemetry module that captures GPS and various other sensor data and transmits that data back to a base station. This project aims to be useful in both the field of amature rocketry and high-altitude balloons.

**Note:** This project is a new project, and will soon include contributions from multiple individuals.


## Used Technologies

This project is built on top of several technologies. 

1. Platform IO: platform-io is a useful library written in Python used to build and upload projects to various microcontrollers. This is used to access a more advanced environment and set of microcontrollers than available using the Arduino IDE without needing to install and configure the specifc micro-controller build tools individually.

2. Arduino framework: the arduino framework has several easy-to-use libraries for interfacing with various devices saving the need to write them independently.
